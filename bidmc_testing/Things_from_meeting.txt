Things from meeting

Try different moving averages (3, instead of 30)
Use code to identify patients with abnormal levels
Plot graph with mean of all patients at different time steps (hr mean at time 0)
Group patients into different age groups (70-80), plot averages for groups
Check individual patient's fluctuations- If any of their values go outside their
standard deviation
Use pandas
Research on double/triple exponential smoothing to make predictions at time + n
Double exponential smoothing tends to overfit
